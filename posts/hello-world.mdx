# Hello, world!

It's been a long time coming and my blog is finally here. I do write quite
exensively but it's usually for my own pleasure and not intended as something
that I was ever going to publish. That changes now because I need a space where
I can work in the open and research (hopefully) together with others. So that's
the simple reasoning behind this blog.

**Note** This is my first blog post here but also where I will test new features
and styling so it will be updated frequently and some of it might seem nonsensical.

I shall try to publish as often as possible and my aspirations are that this will
help me in documenting my findings and becoming better at writing meaningful
documentation. My interests within the field of IT are quite eclectic (just as my
language apparently â€“ who even uses words like that?).

## Heading 2

Either way, my choice of language apart, my goals with this blog on a more technical
level is simply to provide myself with a space that is easy to update and maintain.
I do not need any fancy features or particular design and so, it needs to be very
straight forward and not take unnecessary time from my other work. That's why I went
with a simple NEXT.JS + MDX approach. That way I can simply post updates using `git`
and I already get nice styling options using simple markdown to format my prose.

I'm not going to bother too much with spelling and such, and English isn't my native language
to begin with, because this needs to be a fast and dirty way to get thing out there. hopefully
someone somewhere will find this useful enough.
